# The Art of MUSIC DNA

This is one of the amazing music-art I stumble upon. This is the category of where the music and art molded into one. 

When I am researching how to get information about [martin lewis flight delays](http://flightclaimcompensation.co.uk), I see a Web Audio API and HTML Canvas create a huge dynamic of art using a simple beat. I tried a heavy metal band Disturbed with Megamix and find an amazing result. See the screenshot below. Kudos to [aerotwist](http://lab.aerotwist.com/canvas/music-dna/). I love the idea!
